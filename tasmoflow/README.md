# TasmoFlow

[Français](README.fr.md) · **English**

No-code web interface to control and manage a Tasmota Zigbee gateway, and to create
automations between devices. First target: the eWeLink ZB-GW03 gateway running the
[tasmota32-zbgw03-matter](https://github.com/gnatali/tasmota32-zbgw03-matter) firmware.

> **Status: v0.0 prototype, not yet tested on real hardware.** It checks the architecture
> before features are written. The interface and loader are tested in Chromium against a
> simulated gateway; the Berry code has not run on an ESP32 yet.

## What v0.0 does

- Adds a **TasmoFlow** button to the Tasmota main menu and a `/tf` page.
- Loads the interface from GitHub Pages (pinned version, SRI hash), or from the
  extension's local copy if GitHub does not answer within 3 s.
- Lists Zigbee devices and updates them live.
- Toggles a light, opens pairing, sends a Tasmota command, shows diagnostics (memory,
  file system, where the interface came from).
- French and English, desktop and mobile, light and dark themes.

The firmware is not modified. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) (French).

## Installing on the gateway

1. Build the extension (Python 3, no dependency): `python3 tools/pack_tapp.py`.
   This writes `dist/TasmoFlow.tapp` and prints sizes against their budgets.
2. In Tasmota: **Tools → Manage File system**, upload `dist/TasmoFlow.tapp` (to the root,
   or to `/.extensions/`).
3. Restart the gateway, then open `http://<gateway address>/tf` or click **TasmoFlow** in
   the main menu.

The API listens on port **8384** of the gateway. To uninstall, delete `TasmoFlow.tapp`
and restart.

## Development without a gateway

```sh
python3 tools/pack_tapp.py --cdn ''
python3 tools/mock_gateway.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080/tf>. The simulated gateway serves the real `/tf` page,
extracted from `extension/tasmoflow.be`, and the same API, with three fake devices
sending events.

## License

GPL v3, like Tasmota. `extension/tf_http.be` is a copy of `webserver_async.be`
(Stephan Hadinger and Theo Arends, Tasmota project).
